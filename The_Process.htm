<p>The Professional Aircraft Appraiser must acquire all the facts about the aircraft in
question. The appraiser thoroughly examines the aircraft log books, inspects the exterior
and interior of the aircraft and pays close attention to the present condition and the
maintenance history of the aircraft. The National Aircraft Appraisers
Association's extensive Computer System enables the appraiser to give accurate and prompt
Aircraft Appraisals.</p>

<p>Airplane-Appraisel.Com <u><i>Will Assure the Best Possible Appraisal</i></u> by applying the
following process: 

<ol>
  <li>A Detailed examination of airframe, engines, propellors, instrumentation, avionics and all
    relative systems. </li>
  <li>A Careful review of aircraft documentation including log books etc.. </li>
  <li>A Computer analysis of relevant data. </li>
  <li>A Signed Certificate of Appraisal with detailed computerized report submitted to client.</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Details Follow</u>:</p>

<p>A Certified Aircraft Appraisal begins with a thorough examination of the exterior and
interior of the aircraft.&nbsp; Special attention is paid to the condition of the
airframe, paint, engines, propellers and instrumentation. &nbsp; The avionics and related
flight instruments are inventoried to insure they are properly accounted for in assessing
the value of the aircraft. The panel layout, optional systems, deicing systems, cabin and
interior condition are also evaluated.&nbsp; Airframe and engine modifications as well as
signs of present damage are documented.&nbsp; Service Bulletin status and Airworthiness
Directive (AD) status are reviewed as is the status of any historical damage
repairs.&nbsp; The condition of &quot;wear items&quot;, e.g. tires, paint, interior, etc.
are compared to comprehensive and detailed written NAAA standards. <a href="paint.htm">To

<p>The logbooks and paperwork are carefully reviewed because these document the historical
care or abuse that was given to this particular aircraft. This review documents whether
maintenance was done to keep the aircraft in top condition or just to maintain a minimal
level of air worthiness.&nbsp; Frequently what is not recorded is important, e.g. missing
annual inspections, missing or defaced pages, and undocumented modifications. &nbsp;
Special attention is given to any incidents of past damage as this may or may not have a
significant impact on the aircraft's value.<a href="Damage_History.htm">Click here to

<p>After the aircraft inspection and paperwork examination is complete, the process of
establishing the aircraft's value begins. Utilizing the databases and proprietary software
developed by the NAAA, the information from your aircraft is entered into the NAAA
database (this database is updated every month).&nbsp; After the detailed Aircraft
Appraisal (typically 6 to 12 pages) is generated, it is reviewed by a Certified Appraiser
for accuracy. Once the appraisal has been approved it is signed and stamped as a NAAA
Certified Aircraft Appraisal.<a href="APPRAISAL.PDF">Click here to view a sample report</a>.</O:P>
