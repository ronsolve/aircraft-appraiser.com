  <p>The SINGLE Most Frequently Asked Question is:<br>
  Why not use VREF, TAP or another market source to determine value?<br>
  The Answer is:<br>
  You are not buying or selling an 'average' aircraft.&nbsp; You are buying or selling a
  specific aircraft.&nbsp; An <a href="http://plane-values.com">NAAA</a> certified appraiser
  determines a value based upon the specific aircraft - not some general market
  averages.&nbsp; An appraisel requires the aircraft be seen and the value be verified, in
  person.</p>
