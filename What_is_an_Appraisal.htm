<body>

<p>An aircraft is an expensive investment.&nbsp; Whether it is time to buy, 
sell, donate or determine fair market for litigation purposes - we can help.&nbsp; 

<p>Some of the ways an appraisal&nbsp; is used to: 

<ul>
  <li>Obtain a professional opinion of the present fair market value of an aircraft. </li>
  <li>Obtain a professional opinion of the value of an aircraft to be renovated or modified. </li>
  <li>Provide expert opinion of the value of an aircraft as a prudent safeguard 
	against excessive tax assessments, capital gains and other taxes as well as 
	to justify values in litigation and during donation.</li>
  <li>Verify damage claims resulting from fire, hail, windstorms, accidents and other
    disasters. </li>
  <li>Provide the basis for decision-making in the commitment of funds for acquisition. </li>
  <li>Provide persuasive independent evidence of the condition of an aircraft. </li>
  <li>Assist a prospective purchaser in obtaining financing or insurance. </li>
  <li>Assist the financial institutions by substantiating the nature and value of the aircraft
    as it relates to collateral. </li>
  <li>Assist the financial institution by supporting the Loan Portfolio for examination by the
    loan committee and/or bank examiner. </li>
  <li>Distinguish seller's aircraft from others that may be listed for sale. This should
    reduce the time required to sell an aircraft by 50%. </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><u>The SINGLE Most Frequently Asked Question</u><br>
Why not use VREF, TAP or another market source to determine value?<br>
<u>The Answer</u><br>
You are not buying or selling an 'average' aircraft.&nbsp; You are buying or selling a <strong>specific</strong>
<strong>aircraft</strong>.&nbsp; An NAAA certified
appraiser determines a value based upon the specific aircraft - not some general market
averages.&nbsp; An appraisal requires the aircraft be seen and the value be verified, in
person.</p>
