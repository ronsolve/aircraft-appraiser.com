<ul>
	<li>We SPECIALIZE in appraising Piston and Small Turbo-Prop aircraft as well 
	as 'off-book' aircraft.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>Our appraisals are used in the normal course of buying and selling 
	aircraft as well as in support (and in compliance with IRS regulations) for 
	the&nbsp; DONATION of aircraft and your subsequent tax deduction.&nbsp; We 
	will support you and your accountant by signing your tax return, after 
	completion of an appropriate appraisal,&nbsp; in support of your aircraft 
	donation. </li>
	<li>We will provide expert testimony concerning the value of your aircraft.&nbsp; 
	</li>
	<li>We provide expert value during litigation involving property settlement.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Off-Book aircraft are aircraft that are not currently in or never were 
	in production.&nbsp; We are one of the few aircraft appraisers that will 
	address your 'one of a kind' aircraft - or your 'one of twenty-five left' 
	aircraft or your World War II restoration when you feel it is the correct 
	time to donate the aircraft.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>We have done appraisals for aircraft that 
	have been donated to the Smithsonian.</li>
	</ul>
